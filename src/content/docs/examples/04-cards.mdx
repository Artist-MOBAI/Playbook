## Best Practices

When using the Card component:

1. **Keep titles concise** - Titles are set to ellipsis if they overflow
2. **Use icons purposefully** - Icons should relate to the card content
3. **Limit badge usage** - Use badges sparingly for important metadata
4. **Maintain consistency** - Use the same icon sets across related cards
5. **Group related cards** - Display similar cards together in a grid layout
